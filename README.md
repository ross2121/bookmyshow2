ShowtimeHub Backend
The ShowtimeHub backend is the server-side implementation of a real-time movie booking application. This project is built to handle user authentication, role-based authorization, and dynamic movie-related operations such as booking tickets, managing showtimes, and more.

Features
JWT Authentication: Implements secure user authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
Role-Based Authorization: Access to specific APIs is restricted based on user roles (e.g., admin, manager, customer).
Dynamic Movie Management: Provides APIs for creating, updating, and fetching movie and showtime details.
Database Integration: Manages data persistence for users, movies, showtimes, and bookings.
Secure API Endpoints: Uses middleware to validate requests before processing.
Technologies Used
Backend Framework: Node.js with Express
Database: MongoDB (or another database of your choice)
Authentication: JWT for secure user sessions
Authorization: Middleware to verify roles and permissions
Environment Variables: Securely manage sensitive data with dotenv
Setup and Installation

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/showtimehub-backend.git  
cd showtimehub-backend  
Install Dependencies

bash
Copy code
npm install  
Set Up Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory with the following keys:

env
Copy code
PORT=5000  
DB_URI=your_database_uri  
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key  
Run the Server

bash
Copy code
npm start  
The server will be live at http://localhost:5000.

API Endpoints
Authentication
POST /api/auth/signup
Create a new user account.
POST /api/auth/login
Authenticate and receive a JWT.
Movies and Showtimes
GET /api/movies
Fetch all movies.
POST /api/movies (Admin Only)
Add a new movie.
PUT /api/movies/:id (Admin Only)
Update movie details.
Bookings
POST /api/bookings
Book a ticket.
GET /api/bookings (User-Specific)
Fetch all bookings for the logged-in user.
Role-Based Authorization
The user role (e.g., admin, manager, customer) is embedded in the JWT token.
Middleware decodes the token, extracts the role, and verifies permissions for specific routes.
